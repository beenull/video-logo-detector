Experiment with SIFT:
- Download a video ad and a couple of images of the logos inside.
- Try to capture the video in openCV
- Try to capture a frame
- Try SIFT on the logo
- Try on a training snapshot of the video that contains that logo
- Try to find a match, how to get the bounding box and etc.

Experiment with color spaces:
- Convert the logo to HSV
- Get the histogram of each channel
- Get the highest values of each channel
- Return a margin of values around these values
- Convert the frame to HSV
- Filter out the frame to be within the returned margins
- Display the video
RESULT: FAILED



Notes:
1. Any commercial rarely include the logo. Only at the end of it.
2.
